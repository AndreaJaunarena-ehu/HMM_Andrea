# Practical Group Exercise

In this exercise an HMM model + Viterbi is implemented. The model is trained with a conllu file and tested with another one. **You can find the analysis of the results in the analysis.ipynb file.** In case you want to use the model separately, you can use the our_HMM.py file (command line usage is explained below).

### Implementing an HMM Pos Tagger 

### Instalation

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate # Linux Â¿and MacOS?
source .\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

You must have a file in conllu format to fit the model. That will be the first parameter. Apart from that you have various options.

#### Use a test file

In this mode you test your model in another conllu file. It is passed as `-t`.

```bash
python our_HMM.py <YOUR_TRAIN_FILE>.conllu -t <YOUR_TEST_FILE>.conllu
```

Output:

```python
{'precision_micro': 0.8136248775204992, 'precision_macro': 0.7852392072793883, 'recall_micro': 0.8136248775204992, 'recall_macro': 0.612734531152367, 'f1_micro': 0.8136248775204992, 'f1_macro': 0.6513179995385716, 'accuracy': 0.8136248775204992}
```

#### Test a single sentence

This mode is useful for analyzing how the model performed in a single sentence. Provide the sentence with `-s` (please, separate the symbols like dots with a space).

```bash
python our_HMM.py <YOUR_FILE>.conllu -s "the quick brown fox jump over the lazy dog ."
```

Output:

```
          the_0   quick_1   brown_2      fox_3     jump_4     over_5      the_6     lazy_7      dog_8        ._9

#### Export the matrices

With the `-e` option you may export the emmision and transition matrices generated from the train file to a .csv

```bash
python our_HMM.py <YOUR_FILE>.conllu -e
```
